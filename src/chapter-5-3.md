Sentiment analysis is a technique used to analyze and understand the emotional tone of written content. This is done through natural language processing and machine learning algorithms that extract meaning from text and identify the emotions conveyed within it.

For writers, sentiment analysis can be a powerful tool for understanding how their writing affects readers emotionally. By identifying the emotional tone of their content, writers can adjust their style to better resonate with their audience and create a more engaging reading experience.
